# Tracking-Citizen-s-Concerns-during-COVID-19-Pandemic

COVID-19, the disease caused by the Corona Virus, started from Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, and quickly swept the Asian countries with confirmed cases and deaths. Within two and half months, it started spreading to European countries, and to the US, triggering the pandemic declaration by WHO. Governments around the globe have declared a public health crisis in specific regions and nationwide, with drastic measures taken to contain the spread of the disease. Citizens in this public health crisis are going through a wide range of emotions, such as disbelief, shock, concerns about health, fear about food supplies, anxiety, panic, etc., through directly and viscerally experiencing the disease spreading. We present an approach to measure and monitor citizens’ concern levels using public sentiments in Twitter data. Our approach shows temporal and geographic spread of citizens’ concerns during the COVID-19 public health crisis.

We used Twitter API to collect COVID-19 related Tweet data from 3/13 to 3/28, 2020.
(President Trump declared State emergency on 3/13.)
30000 Tweets on 3/13, 32% contain US state location info.
24463 Tweets from 3/14 to 3/21.
Tweets for different government measures, 20000 for each respectively. Measures include test kit, self isolation, school closing, business closing, social distance, mask and ventilator.

We showed an approach to tracking citizens’ concern levels and emotions during public health crises and their concern levels towards government measures and guidelines. The sentiment-based monitoring will allow governments to understand the citizens’ mental and emotional issues and hotspots to address them before the impact of disease anxiety becomes damaging on its own. We are working on several extensions, including the near-real-time surveillance, and utilizing additional social media sources (e.g. Reddit). These can be integrated with authoritative sources (e.g., CDC) for identifying the hotspots of diseases, emotion-based concern hotspots of population groups, and for identifying major topics and discussion threads.
